# Data-Structures

This repository contains a Dynamic Array Class and a Circular Dynamic Array Class, as well as a Stack and Queue class built upon the DA and CDA respectively. It is written in C for my Data Structures and Algorithms Class (CS201), and can be tested with integers using "make test" from the command line.
